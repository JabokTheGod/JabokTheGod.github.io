        <h1>Here are some thoughts I have about college</h1>
        <p>
            I would say the best parts of college are the friends that I have met and the freedom of not living at home. Besides that college brings me a lot of stress. When Covid happened I really struggled with keeping up and my motivation has swindled lower year by year. <br><br>
            In order for me to find college enjoyable there would have to be some changes within the system. I think that gen eds should be reduced and allow the students who know what degree they want to fast track through school. I also think that there needs to be an investment to have more academic advisors that can spend more time with students and figure things out early in school.
